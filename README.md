# Odin HashMap

This project implements a solution to the HashMap data structure as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The HashMap implementation demonstrates key concepts in data structures, particularly how to manage key-value pairs efficiently.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports adding, removing, and checking for keys.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically adjusts capacity based on load factor to maintain efficiency.
- **Collision Handling**: Utilizes linked lists to handle collisions in the hash table.
- **Clear and Retrieve Entries**: Provides methods to clear the map and retrieve all entries.

## How to Run

To run the HashMap or HashSet, use Node.js with the following command:

```bash
node hashMap.js
```

or

```bash
node hashSet.js
```
